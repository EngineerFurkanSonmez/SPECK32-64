# SPECK32-64

This repository contains a C implementation of the Speck 32/64 block cipher. Speck is a family of lightweight block ciphers designed by the National Security Agency (NSA). This specific version, Speck 32/64, operates on 32-bit blocks and uses a 64-bit key.

## `main.c`

The `main.c` file includes the core functions for the Speck 32/64 cipher:

*   **Key Schedule:** `speck32_key_schedule`
*   **Encryption:** `speck32_encrypt`
*   **Decryption:** `speck32_decrypt`

It also contains (commented out) example usage of these functions.

## API Documentation

### `void speck32_key_schedule(const uint16_t K[4], uint16_t round_keys[22])`

*   **Description:** Generates the round keys required for encryption and decryption.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `K`: A 4-element array of `uint16_t` representing the 64-bit key.
    *   `round_keys`: A 22-element array of `uint16_t` where the generated round keys will be stored.

### `void speck32_encrypt(uint16_t block[2], const uint16_t round_keys[22])`

*   **Description:** Encrypts a 32-bit data block using the generated round keys.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `block`: A 2-element array of `uint16_t` representing the 32-bit data block to be encrypted. The encrypted data will be stored back in this array.
    *   `round_keys`: The array of round keys generated by `speck32_key_schedule`.

### `void speck32_decrypt(uint16_t block[2], const uint16_t round_keys[22])`

*   **Description:** Decrypts a 32-bit data block using the generated round keys.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `block`: A 2-element array of `uint16_t` representing the 32-bit data block to be decrypted. The decrypted data will be stored back in this array.
    *   `round_keys`: The array of round keys generated by `speck32_key_schedule`.

## Usage

### Compilation

To compile the code, you can use a C compiler like GCC:

```bash
gcc main.c -o speck_cipher
```

### Running the Example

The `main.c` file includes a commented-out `main` function that demonstrates the usage of the cipher. To run it:

1.  Uncomment the `main` function block at the end of `main.c`.
2.  Compile the code as shown above.
3.  Run the executable:

    ```bash
    ./speck_cipher
    ```

    This will encrypt and then decrypt a sample data block, printing the results to the console.
